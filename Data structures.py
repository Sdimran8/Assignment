#LIST: Mutuable []

#1.Lists are mutable, meaning that after creation, we can modify their elements.
#2.It consists of data separated by commas inside square braces [].
#3.Lists allow duplicate elements.
#4.We can concatenate lists using + and repeat elements using * operators.
#5.We use indexing to access the list elements (0 to length - 1), and negative indexing is allowed too (-1 to -length).

#TUPLE: Immutuable ()

#1. Tuples allow duplicate elements like lists.
#2. We use indexing to access the tuple elements (0 to length - 1), and negative indexing is allowed too (-1 to -length).
#3. Creating a tuple without parenthesis is called "Tuple packing" and to access a tuple, we can also use "Tuple unpacking".
#4. Iterating through a tuple is much faster than iterating through a list.
#5. As a tuple is immutable, it can be used as a key in dictionaries.

#SETS: UNIQUE ELEMENTS {} UNORDED

#1 : It is a mutable data type and is iterable
#2 : We can add or delete elements from a set, but we can't perform slicing or indexing operations on a set.
#3 : If more than one element is placed in an index, the values are arranged in a linked list to that index position.
#4 : Every index position acts as a key, and the members/ values in the index are stored as values inside a dictionary.
#5 : A set won't allow mutable items as its elements like lists:

#DICTIONARY {key:Value} pairs UNORDERD

#1 : Keys identify values. Hence, a key has to be unique and immutable. Only immutable data types are accepted to be keys.
#2 : Any data type can be used to make a value as it is the data.
#3 : There cannot be any duplicate keys, but duplicate values are allowed.
#4 : We can also use dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary like list comprehension.
#5 : The dictionary's keys are like the Roll numbers of students, and the values are the students'names.
